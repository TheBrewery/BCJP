With a medium hop characteristic on the palate, this typically amber-colored beer is brewed as a lager or ale and can have a medium candy-like caramel malt sweetness. This style may contain adjuncts such as corn, rice and sugar, which help dry out the finish and lessen the body. It also often contains roasted barley, lending low roasted notes, darker color and possibly creating a tan collar of foam. With notes of caramel, toffee and sometimes low-level diacetyl (butter), think of this beer style as a cousin to lightly-toasted and buttered bread.source: CraftBeer.com",

These beers are very pale in color, and may be cloudy as they are often unfiltered. Hops are not a feature of this style, but these beers often do showcase esters. Traditional versions often showcase Brettanomyces yeast. Growing in popularity in the U.S., where many brewers are now adding  traditional and exotic fruits to the recipe, resulting in flavorful finishes with striking, colorful hues. These beers are incredible when pairing. Bitterness, alcohol and residual sugar are very low, allowing the beer’s acidity, white bread and graham cracker malt flavors to shine. Carbonation is very high, adding to the refreshment factor this style delivers. Many examples of this style contain no hops and thus no bitterness at all.source: CraftBeer.com",

The aroma and flavor of a weissbier comes largely from the yeast and is decidedly fruity (banana) and phenolic (clove). ‘Weizen’ means “wheat” and ‘hefe’ means “yeast.” There are multiple  variations to this style. Filtered versions are known as ‘kristal weizen’ and darker versions are referred to as ‘dunkels,’ with a stronger, bock-like version called ‘weizenbock. This is commonly a very highly carbonated style with a long-lasting collar of foam.source: CraftBeer.com",

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the unique character of the wood and/or the flavor of what has previously been in the barrel. Today’s craft brewers are using wood (mostly oak) to influence flavor, and aromatics. Beer may be aged in wooden barrels (new or previously used to age wine or spirits), or chips, spirals and cubes may be added to the conditioning tanks that normally house beer. A variety of types of wood are used including oak, apple, alder, hickory and more. The interior of most barrels is charred or toasted to further enhance the flavor of the wood.source: CraftBeer.com",

These beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. The addition of rye to a beer can add a spicy or pumpernickel character to the flavor and finish. Color can also be enhanced and may become more red from the use of rye. The ingredient has come into vogue in recent  years in everything from stouts to lagers, but is especially popular with craft brewers in India pale ales. To be considered an example of the style, the grain bill should include sufficient rye such that rye character is evident in the beer.source: CraftBeer.com",
